# Wiki.js Infrastructure – OpsGuru Hiring Assessment

## Overview

This project provisions a **secure, scalable, and observable cloud infrastructure** for deploying [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform on AWS.  
The goal is to demonstrate best practices in automation, security, and modular cloud architecture.

## 🛠️ Architecture Summary

| Component           | Technology                |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cloud Provider** | AWS                       |
| **IaC Tool**       | Terraform (modular setup) |
| **Compute**        | ECS Fargate               |
| **Database**       | RDS PostgreSQL            |
| **Secrets**        | AWS Secrets Manager       |
| **Networking**     | VPC with public/private subnets |
| **Load Balancer**  | Application Load Balancer (ALB) |
| **Monitoring**     | CloudWatch Logs           |
| **Security**       | IAM Roles, Scoped Security Groups |

Each module is self-contained and reusable, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- All secrets (e.g., DB credentials) are securely stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**
- **IAM roles** are scoped using *least privilege* principles
- The **ALB** only allows inbound traffic on ports **80/443**
- **RDS** is not publicly accessible and is reachable only from ECS tasks within the private subnet

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Prerequisites:**
> - Terraform installed ([docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install))  
> - AWS credentials configured

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

#### 📌 Notable Features
Fully modular Terraform design

Environment-agnostic (easily extendable for dev/staging/prod)

Clean separation of concerns between networking, compute, security, and secrets

Infrastructure can be deployed with a single command

#### 📊 Observability
Application and service logs are collected via CloudWatch Logs

ALB access logs can be enabled for traffic analysis

Ready for integration with Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS X-Ray

#### 📎 Additional Notes
Designed to be production-grade with minimal adjustments

Can be extended with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Atlantis)

#### Recommended improvements:

Add autoscaling policies

WAF integration

Cost monitoring and tagging strategy
